- The order in which the responses were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Response A and Response B are **equally likely** to be the better.
- The length of the responses should NOT affect your judgement, as a longer response does not necessarily correspond to a better response. When making your decision, evaluate if the response length is appropriate for the given instruction.
